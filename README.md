# Video-segment-based-on-SAM2-
This is an implementation of the SAM2 model. Very strong at video segmentation.

# Abilites
1. Frames the video based on every 10 fps.
2. use x,y coordinates to select the main item.
3. Gray out the background and render all the other frames.
4. Joint frames into video.
